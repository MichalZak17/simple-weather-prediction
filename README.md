# Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks (`Temperature.ipynb` and `Temperature2.ipynb`) exploring and visualizing climate change data, focusing on Earth's surface temperatures. The analyses provide insights into how global temperatures have changed over time, including seasonal variations and average land temperatures by country, alongside additional detailed data investigations.

## Datasets

The analyses are based on two comprehensive datasets from Kaggle:

1. [Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data) - This dataset includes global temperatures from 1750 to 2015, offering a detailed view of climate change over the last few centuries.

2. [Climate Change Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarunrm09/climate-change-indicators) - A compilation of various climate change indicators, providing a multifaceted view of the impacts and trends associated with global warming.

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks are structured to cover various aspects of climate data analysis:

- **Exploration and Visualization**: Initial exploration of the datasets, focusing on understanding the data structure and key variables.

- **Country Variable for Further Analysis**: Detailed analysis of temperatures by country, preparing the data for in-depth examination.

- **Seasonal Temperatures**: Investigation of temperature changes across different seasons, highlighting how climate varies throughout the year.

- **Average Land Temperature by Country**: Analysis of average land temperatures for countries around the world, showcasing global warming trends and differences among nations.

The notebooks also include comprehensive data analysis techniques and visualizations to better understand the effects of climate change.

## Getting Started

To explore the analyses, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebooks installed or use Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` files.
3. Download the datasets from Kaggle and place them in the same directory as the notebooks for seamless integration.

## Dependencies

The notebooks use several Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Ensure these are installed in your environment before running the notebooks.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the analyses or improve the visualizations are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
